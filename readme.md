# Leave On Time - iPhone App

## Overview

The **Leave On Time** app is designed to help users build better consistency with their daily routines by sending timely reminders to leave the house. It encourages accountability through notifications and clock-ins, helping users stay on track with their schedule.

## Key Features

- **Daily Notifications**: The app sends a notification at a pre-specified time to remind the user when it's time to leave the house.
  
- **Clock-In System**: Once the user leaves, they can "clock in" via the app to confirm they've departed on time.

- **Tracking Consistency**: The app maintains a log of each clock-in, allowing users to track their consistency over time. This can serve as motivation to improve punctuality.

## How It Works

1. **Set a Time**: The user sets a time when they'd like to be reminded to leave.
2. **Receive Notifications**: At the specified time, the app sends a notification reminding the user to head out.
3. **Clock In**: The user taps the notification, opens the app, and clocks in to confirm they are on schedule.
4. **View History**: Users can review a list of their clock-in times to track how often they've left on time.
